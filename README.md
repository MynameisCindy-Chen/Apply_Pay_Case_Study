# Apply Pay Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Apple pay is owned by company Apple, which is founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne on April 1<sup>st</sup>, 1976. In 1976, the company started up and named " Apple Computer Company". Apple I is their first selling product, which is an incompleted personal computer. However, Wayne decided to leave the company and sell his share to Jobs and Wonzniak on April 12<sup>th</sup>. After that, there is a essential opportunity that Jobs and Wozniak meet multimillionaire Mike Markkula. He was so impressive and highly interested on their idea and creation. He offered a large amounts of funding to support them, which is $250,000 in US currency, equivalent to USD $1,117,930 in 2021 (Apple Inc. - Wikipedia, 1976). Due to this strong supportive funding, Apple Computer Inc. was incorporated on January 3<sup>rd</sup> 1977. 

Apply is consistently seeking new opportunity and using their creation and technique to produce multiple high-tech products that we have never seen before, which can be defined as creator. This is the startup point for the concept of Apple pay appeared in our modern society starting from 20th century. In order to achieve this idea, this is a long preparation period.

## Business Activities:
Since this was a new domain and cognition for them, Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments (Jeffries, 2014). Also, they corporated with VISA, Mastecard and American Express to work on this project together and see how to make it work through electronic devices. Nowadays traditional methods of payments are not sercured enough, there are lots of cases happened related to theft and private information stolen. Physical bank card payment is one of major causes of those consequence. "Apple says the attack was due to weak passwords and security questions, not a breach of its systems, but it's a reminder that the average consumer's data is relatively easy to steal (Jeffries, 2014)." In order to improve the security of payment and ensure the project executed privately, relevant employees worked tirelessly in a serect area provided by JPMorgan Chase, and most of employee themselve did not even know the partner is Apple. The project was proceed in a strictly confidental environment. Obviously, competitors are never aware and unable to generate the same idea to be the first one to announce this new technology. This joint project started in January 2013. After one year and 8 months, this service was debuted by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the time of annuncing Apple 6 release on September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2014. This is beneficial to all Apple users who are using compatible Apple devices. The usage is simple and easy. For example, Apple already install defaulted app 'Apple Wallet', people only need to add their bank cards manually to Apple Wallet. Once you go out to any stores that need to make a payment, you can simply tap to the authorized machine via touch ID. They uses the technology of Near Field Communication (NFC) to limit the distance between your phone and the payment machine. This service can keep customer payment information private from others. Furthermore, the traditional payment transaction need to track Funding Primary Account Number with static recurity code so that each payment leave a record which is easier to spread those information. Apple resolved this concern by creating dymatic security code(one-time-use) and secure element chip, making payment by touch ID. More importantly, Apple announced that their devices restricted to track transactions, which means each transaction only involved consumers, vendors and banks.

According to this graph from eMarketer, Apple has 43.9 million US users in 2021, which is the top mobile payment player compared with Starbucks, Google Pay and Samsung pay.

## Landscape:

Technology innovation make a great impact on financial services and products, and payment is a sector of financial services.  During this 10 years, the most significant change is the method of making payments are apparently more convenient and continuously improving, the main focus on payment renovation was consumer convenience. In 2013, PayPal started offering P2P transfers, which can simply send money request through email address or phone number. In 2014, Bitcoin network existed, and Apple introduced touchless payment Apple Pay. In 2015, Samsung announced Samsung pay mobile app as well. In 2018, mastercard implemented biometric authentication on mastercard. In 2019, Facebook created their own cryptocurrency and introduced Facebook pay. Lots of changes on forming new payment happens year after year. From domestic side, we can see the huge change via platforms, interfaces and payment method. However, cross-boarder payment happened outside of the country is not that convenient and improving slowly, also, transaction fee is always expensive. International coordination is one of obstructions that lead a progress to next level. Communication and cooperation between countries and countries are complex and more difficult. Rules, regulations and restrictions setup for international trade are not as easy as domestic trade. The coordination existence which cause the difficulty on collection of data. Experts need completed database to analyze and understand better the problem is. Then they can do the next step to address the issue and make it work more efficiently.

According to statistic data from CFTE Fintech Unicorns, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal are the top 3 largest payment companies in 2021 (Fintech Unicorns in the USA | Full List 2021, 2021). They are all specific for payment and billing only. Their developmemt and growth are highly related to our daily lives, combining technology together to provide financial service in a more efficient and secure way that to satisfy consumer need. 

## Results

At the beginning of Apple pay release, not lots of people know that iphone 6 has this function. According to PYMNTS.com, "More than 95 percent of iPhone 6 and 6+ users who could have paid with Apple Pay on Black Friday didn’t (Apple Pay’s Impact On Payments, 2015)." Also, some customers have security concern if phone lost private information leakage including bank card saved in the phone. However, since more merchants are willing to accept it, more and more iphone users started using this function as the truth is promoting checkouts faster and reducing the sequences of lineup making payment, which is time-saving. Especially the fear of Covid-19 by using touchless payment method which is one of helpful behaviours to prevent from getting covid. Apple users found that Apple Pay has more security when they started using it for a while. Generally, the existence of Apple Pay not only bring the convenience of consumers, but also it is a conpetitive edge for the merchants who do bussiness to make transactions. 

There are 6 core metrics to measure success in payment industry:

- Numbers of users
- Active users
- Retention
- Cohort analysis
- Lifetime value

According to the chart of US Proximity mobile payment users by Platform in 2021 (listed in business activity section), Apple owns the greatest numbers of US users compared with competitors. Nowadays, Apple Pay dominates the US mobile payment market with a 43.9% share (A., 2022), which is closed to 50% almost the half of US population. The most interesting data is, as of 2020, 5,480 banks worldwide supported Apple Pay. This represents a growth of 29% compared to the year before and 41% compared to 2018 (A., 2022). From those statistics data, Apple pay usage is in well performance and experiencing a surge which is affecting US and Europe in high demand.  They have great advantage compared with competitors.  

As I mentioned above, Apple own the technology of near-field communications, they allow google to use NPC. Whereas,  "Apple for the most part blocks other companies and developers from using its NFC application programming interface (API) for their own products, including mobile-wallet apps(Detrixhe, 2019)." That is the main factor that Apple Pay almost dominate contactless payment market. There is an exception happened in China. China has entirely different technology by using optical QR codes, which is Wechat Pay and Alipay Pay. These 2 leading company dominate chinese mobile payment market. 

## Recommendations

Although Apple is always in a great performance on contactless payment, I want to make a recommendation from the experience by using Wechat. Wechat also has Wechat wallet just like Apple wallet, we all know the funcation is wechat pay. However, Wechat wallet can also deposit money via peer-to-peer(P2P) money transfer, it can be defined as the combination of Paypal and wechat pay. Moreover, I can use wechat to make billing payment such as phone bill, utility bill and credit card etc..., more surprisedly, I can do some personal investments as well, such as mutual fund and insurances. In general, Wechat is a extremely powerful app that including almost everything we need in our lives. From my suggestion, Apple can improve the function of Apple wallet allows users to deposit money in apple wallet, it can be a seperate sector beside bank card section. Then we can use those money to pay all bills instead of entering bank card information manually through online payment method. If Apple own this technology, it will attract more people to buy iphone which can increase their revenue and sales. Certainly, stock price will go up as well which can bring increditable value to the company. 

For money deposit service added to Apple wallet,  the techonology Customer Relationship Mannage(CRM) software can be utilised,  this software can orgnize users basic contact information and find all needed information in one place which is effective for data management if users deposit money to that account. All-in-one platform can be used on paying bills and personal financial investment by clicking that icon and follow the direction for each step. Definitely, this service only can be implemented under the condition of relevent companys and orginzations are willing to join and cooperate with Apple.
